== DESCRIPTION

ZenTest provides 4 different tools: zentest, unit_diff, autotest, and
multiruby.

zentest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing
code based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker pace.
zentest only works with Ruby and Minitest or Test::Unit. There is
enough evidence to show that this is still proving useful to users, so
it stays.

unit_diff is a command-line filter to diff expected results from
actual results and allow you to quickly see exactly what is wrong.
Do note that minitest 2.2+ provides an enhanced assert_equal obviating
the need for unit_diff

autotest is a continous testing facility meant to be used during
development. As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the
corresponding dependent tests.

multiruby runs anything you want on multiple versions of ruby. Great
for compatibility checking! Use multiruby_setup to manage your
installed versions.

== FEATURES

* Scans your ruby code and tests and generates missing methods for you.
* Includes a very helpful filter for Test/Spec output called unit_diff.
* Continually and intelligently test only those files you change with autotest.
* Test against multiple versions with multiruby.
* Includes a LinuxJournal article on testing with ZenTest written by Pat Eyler.

== STRATEGERY

There are two strategeries intended for ZenTest: test conformance
auditing and rapid XP.

For auditing, ZenTest provides an excellent means of finding methods
that have slipped through the testing process. I've run it against my
own software and found I missed a lot in a well tested
package. Writing those tests found 4 bugs I had no idea existed.

ZenTest can also be used to evaluate generated code and execute your
tests, allowing for very rapid development of both tests and
implementation.

== AUTOTEST TIPS

Setting up your project with a custom setup is easily done by creating
a ".autotest" file in your project. Here is an example of adding some
plugins, using minitest as your test library, and running rcov on full
passes:

    require 'autotest/restart'

    Autotest.add_hook :initialize do |at|
      at.testlib = "minitest/autorun"
    end

    Autotest.add_hook :all_good do |at|
      system "rake rcov_info"
    end if ENV['RCOV']

Do note, since minitest ships with ruby19, if you want to use the
latest minitest gem you need to ensure that the gem activation occurs!
To do this, add the gem activation and the proper require to a
separate file (like ".minitest.rb" or even a test helper if you have
one) and use that for your testlib instead:

.minitest.rb:

    gem "minitest"
    require "minitest/autorun"

.autotest:

    Autotest.add_hook :initialize do |at|
      at.testlib = ".minitest"
    end

If you prefer to suffix test files with "_test.rb" (instead of the
default which prefixes test files with "test_") you can change the
mapping by installing the autotest-suffix plugin. To do this first
install the autotest-suffix gem:

    $ gem install autotest-suffix

Then add the following to the ".autotest" file:

    require "autotest/suffix"

== SYNOPSIS

  ./TestMyProject.rb | unit_diff

  autotest

  multiruby_setup mri:svn:current
  multiruby ./TestMyProject.rb
